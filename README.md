# Augmify

A Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador (MLSA) Project Wing Collaborative  focusing on Extended Reality (XR) technologies. This project combines Web AR portfolio creation and facial tracking capabilities.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project consists of two main components:

1. **AR Portfolio**: An interactive portfolio system using Unity that allows users to create immersive AR portfolios and business cards.

2. **AR Face Tracker**: A facial recognition and tracking system built with Unity AR Foundation.

## üöÄ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- Unity 2022.3 LTS or newer installed
- Basic knowledge of C# programming
- Git installed on your computer

# Part 1: AR Portfolio Implementation Guide

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Game Engine**: Unity 2022.3+
- **AR Framework**: AR Foundation
- **Programming**: C#, JavaScript
- **Version Control**: Git

# Face Recognition System Implementation Guide

## Understanding the System

The face recognition system we're building will capture faces through the device camera, detect them using AR Foundation, and match them against a pre-existing database to retrieve information like name and age. Think of it as a digital attendance system or identity verification tool.

### Building for Mobile

For Android:
```
1. Player Settings adjustments:
   - Minimum API Level: 24
   - Target API Level: Latest
   - Required permissions:
 	* Camera
 	* Internet (if using online database)
 	* Write External Storage (for local database)
```

For iOS:
```
1. Player Settings requirements:
   - Minimum iOS Version: 11.0
   - Camera Usage Description
   - Required frameworks:
 	* ARKit
 	* CoreML (if using for face recognition)
```
